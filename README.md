# GPU
GPU development staging area

An intermediate space between my thoughts and production. Not even alpha
quality. In public so I can refer to it easily in discussions.

All code here is under the LLVM license as LLVM is the most likely production
target. It's mostly written by me, sometimes written by me and then shipped
to LLVM and then copied here, and sometimes modified by other people in the
LLVM tree in the meantime.
